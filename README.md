# 🔐 Secure File Storage Using Hybrid Cryptography

A Python-based application for securely storing and transferring files using **hybrid cryptography**, combining the strength of symmetric and asymmetric encryption. This project ensures confidentiality, integrity, and ease of use through an intuitive GUI and secure communication channels.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔒 **AES Encryption (Symmetric)** for fast and secure file encryption
- 🔑 **RSA Encryption (Asymmetric)** for secure key exchange
- 🧠 **PBKDF2** for strong password-based key derivation
- 🖥️ **Tkinter GUI** for user-friendly interface
- 🌐 **Socket Programming** for encrypted file transfer over network
- 🧪 Built with strong cryptography libraries like `cryptography` and `pycryptodome`

## 🚀 How It Works

1. 🔐 A file is encrypted using AES (symmetric).
2. 🔑 The AES key is encrypted with RSA (asymmetric).
3. 📤 The encrypted file and encrypted key are transferred.
4. 🔓 The receiver uses their RSA private key to decrypt the AES key.
5. 📁 The file is decrypted using the AES key.

🔐 Security Note
RSA keys should be stored securely.

This project is a proof-of-concept; production-grade implementations require additional measures (e.g., certificate validation, secure transport protocols like TLS).
